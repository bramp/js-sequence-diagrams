Example
-------
We turn

    Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
    Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!

into

![Sample generated UML diagram](http://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/images/sample.svg)

Requirements
------------
You will need [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com/), [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) and optionally [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).


Installation
----------------------

### bower

Just run `bower install bramp/js-sequence-diagrams` and include the scripts below:

```html
<script src="{{ bower directory }}/raphael/raphael-min.js"></script>
<script src="{{ bower directory }}/underscore/underscore-min.js"></script>
<script src="{{ bower directory }}/js-sequence-diagrams/build/sequence-diagram-min.js"></script>
```

### Manually

You can download the dependencies (see requirements above) and include them on your page like so:

```html
<script src="underscore-min.js"></script>
<script src="raphael-min.js"></script>
<script src="sequence-diagram-min.js"></script>
```

Usage
-----

You can use the Diagram class like:

```html
<div id="diagram">Diagram will be placed here</div>
<script> 
  var diagram = Diagram.parse("A->B: Does something");
  diagram.drawSVG('diagram');
</script>
```

or use jQuery to do all the work:
```html
<div class="diagram">A->B: Message</div>
<script>
$(".diagram").sequenceDiagram({theme: 'hand'});
</script>
```

Build requirements
------------------
The build is managed by a Makefile, and uses various tools available from npm. Thus both `make` and [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) are required, and can easily be installed on any Linux or Mac machine.

```bash
make
```

The Makefile will use npm to install all the dev dependencies, build, and test.

Testing
-------

We use [qunit](https://qunitjs.com/) for testing. It can be ran from the command line, or via a browser. The command line actually tests multiple permutations of [lodash](https://lodash.com/), [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), and with and without minification.

```bash
make test
...
Global summary:
┌───────┬───────┬────────────┬────────┬────────┬─────────┐
│ Files │ Tests │ Assertions │ Failed │ Passed │ Runtime │
├───────┼───────┼────────────┼────────┼────────┼─────────┤
│ 1     │ 13    │ 231        │ 0      │ 231    │ 250     │
└───────┴───────┴────────────┴────────┴────────┴─────────┘
```

or `make` and then open test/qunit.html in a browser. Finally a simple playground is available at test/test.html.

How to release
--------------
* Make sure all changes checked in
* Bump version in src/main.js and bower.json
* ``make clean``
* ``make``
* ``git add -f src/main.js bower.json build/sequence-diagram-min.js build/sequence-diagram-min.js.map``
* ``git commit -m "Released version 1.x.x"``
* ``git push origin master``
* ``git tag -a v1.x.x -m v1.x.x``
* ``git push origin v1.x.x``

Adding a Font
-------------

Raphael requires Cufon style fonts. Find the font you want in ttf or otf format, visit [Cufon's site](http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/) and process it into a javascript file. Then ensure the font is included via the HTML, or recompile after altering main.js. So far only the hand drawn font, Daniel Bold, has been included.


TODO
----
* Other themes
* Rethink the use of Raphael. Due to its support of VML (which I don't care about), it makes many things harder. For example, font support, css styling, etc. Perhaps draw the SVG by hand, or find a small helper library
* Automate the release process
* Dozens of other issues on https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams/issues

Thanks
------
This project makes use of [Jison](http://zaach.github.io/jison/), Raphaël, underscore.js, and the awersome [Daniel font](http://www.dafont.com/daniel.font) (which is free to use for any purpose).

Many thanks to [Web Sequence Diagrams](http://www.websequencediagrams.com/) which greatly inspired this project, and forms the basis for the syntax.
